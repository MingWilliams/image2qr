# image2qr
image processing
A different look of an image file.
Currently just try converting a 24-bit Windows bmp file to an image that looks like a QR code.
And this QR code is not that complex.
Actually, just some black or white blocks.
I will add some annotations to make my project easy to understand.
Further improvements and perfection will be added soon, such as JPEG support, algorithm change...
